This repository consists of files required for end to end implementation and deployment of Machine Learning NLP Restaurant Reviews Sentiment Analysis web application created with flask and deployed using the HTML.

About the App
The Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis is a Flask web application which classifies/detects sentiments of users or viewers as positive or negative sentiments. In this ML-NLP model, restaurant reviews dataset from Kaggle (also available in UCI ML Library) was used to perform Sentiment Analysis using Stemming and Bag of Words model to classify reviews into two sentiments — Liked(1) and Disliked(0). Since, the data is fairly balanced, we are only concerned with accuracy_score. From various Classifiers, highest accuracy achieved was 81% with cross_val_score of 84.92%.

The code is written in Python 3.6.10 and it makes use of NLTK library for text processing.
